          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600 mb-4">Technology Stack</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> React, Redux for state management, Tailwind CSS for styling</li>
            <li><strong>Backend:</strong> Node.js, Express.js</li>
            <li><strong>Database:</strong> PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> JWT, Google Auth API</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> Stripe API</li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Fly.io for both frontend and backend hosting</li>
            <li><strong>CI/CD:</strong> GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment</li>
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Git and GitHub</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600 mb-4">Development and Deployment Process</h2>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Utilized Git for version control, with GitHub as the remote repository host. Implemented a branching strategy to manage features, bugfixes, and releases effectively.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Development:</strong> Used Docker to create a consistent development environment across the team, ensuring that all developers had the same setup for the database, backend, and frontend services.</li>
            <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Implemented comprehensive unit and integration tests using Jest for both frontend and backend. Utilized React Testing Library for component testing.</li>
            <li><strong>CI/CD Pipeline:</strong> Set up GitHub Actions to automate the testing and deployment process:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>On every pull request, automated tests are run to ensure code quality.</li>
                <li>Upon merging to the main branch, the application is automatically built and deployed to a staging environment.</li>
                <li>Production deployments are triggered manually after approval in the staging environment.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Utilized Fly.io for deployment, leveraging its ability to host both the frontend and backend:
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2 space-y-1">
                <li>Frontend is served as a static site, benefiting from Fly.io's global CDN for fast content delivery.</li>
                <li>Backend is deployed as a Docker container, ensuring consistency between development and production environments.</li>
                <li>Database is hosted on a managed PostgreSQL instance provided by Fly.io, simplifying database management and scaling.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Monitoring and Logging:</strong> Implemented Sentry for error tracking and logging, and set up Datadog for performance monitoring and alerting.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-indigo-600 mb-4">Challenges and Solutions</h2>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Designed the backend with scalability in mind, using microservices architecture to allow independent scaling of different components.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> Implemented rate limiting, CORS policies, and regular security audits to ensure the application's security. Used environment variables and secret management tools to handle sensitive information securely.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Optimized database queries, implemented caching strategies, and used lazy loading for frontend components to ensure fast load times and a smooth user experience.</li>
